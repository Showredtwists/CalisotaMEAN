# Angular8
Full Stack MEAN App using MongoDB, Express, Angular8, Material, Nodejs, and JWT Auth. 

# MongoDB
using MongoDB Atlas ;)

# NODE
run "node app.js" from server folder.

# Angular8
run "ng serve" from Angular8 folder.

     "npm start" ( im just learning the difference
And seeing as the script will grow would
Npm start not be a better way
Only say this because as is would this ng serve not 
Demand more specific coding rather then npm start during
Its growth ? Understanding u have scaffolding
Done and not sure of my grasp here but from what i gathered
Npm start n ng serve basically same thing if using in a small cli ??? Please 
Elaborate on this choice you made :) thank u
